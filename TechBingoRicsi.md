**PROJECTS**

_Below you find the description, a recommended technology and a relative complexity (from 1 to 10, where 1 is the simplest and 10 is the most complex) for each project._

**1. Time tracking system 1.**
_Description:_ A tool for a company, where users (employees of the company) can log how much did they work on different tasks, while they were on-site in the office. All employees have a dedicated computer.

_Technology:_

_Complexity:_ 1


**2. Time tracking system 2.**
_Description:_ A tool for a company, where users (employees of the company) can log how much did they work on different tasks, while they were either on- or off-site (either at home office, or at clients). You can safely assume that they have internet access at all times.

_Technology:_

_Complexity:_ 2


**3. Precision agriculture sensor system**
_Description:_ A farmer wants to know the humidity on each acres of her farm which is a contiguous area of one km^2. She would like to see the measurements on her ipad.

_Technology:_ Application, with sensors built in the farm. App because it can work offline, the sensors are sending the data to the app. Mobile Web App because the sensors need internet connection to send the humidity data.  Maybe PWA for sending push notifications.

_Complexity:_ 10


**4. A 3D-heavy FPS game**
_Description:_ A 3D-heavy, single player FPS game, where your goal is to kill the unicorn king.

_Technology:_ Native App since they are a better option for games

_Complexity:_ 8


**5. Notes app**
_Description:_ Software which is capable of saving your notes while you're on the go. It should be able to process speech to text, and handdrawing.

When it comes online, it should be able to sync your notes across all your devices.

_Technology:_ Progressive Web App like Gmail, which pretty much does the same already. It needs to be progrssive because it needs the microphone of the device. A handwriting function must be built in as well.

_Complexity:_ 4


**6. Smart mirror**
_Description:_ An augmented reality application, with what you can try on virtually designed clothes and jewellery.

_Technology:_ Mobile App, mert kamera, ruha-, ékszer dizájn és a kettő együtt (=ruhák, ékszerek felpróbálása) mehet internetkapcsolat nélkül is + personalization-kor van értelme a Mobile App-nek

_Complexity:_ 7


**7. A blog**
_Description:_ A blog which can be edited from any device (given the right screen size, and the adequate peripherials) on-line.

_Technology:_ Web App like Google Docs

_Complexity:_ 3


**8. Mobile version of an existing marketplace**
_Description:_ There's an online marketplace, built using PHP, with millions of products, a plethora of shopping and delivery modes, and it is being developed for 10 years. Now the management wants to build a mobile version.

_Technology:_ Responsive Mobile website because of shareability, reach, upgradability. App nem lenne jó ötlet, mert több millió termékhez óriási méretű alkalmazásra lenne szükség és ennek a verzióit lefejleszteni a különböző operációs rendszerekre nagyon pénz- és időigényes.

_Complexity:_ 6
